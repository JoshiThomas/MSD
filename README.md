Mobile System Development
----------------------------------

This topic was chosen due to witnessing longer waiting times and queues in supermarkets around; especially on weekends. Although there are self-checkout machines, there have been queues even at these machines. This topic would also allow exploring various technologies like APIs, using GPS location, structuring the code in MVC, mobile databases, and help to learn development of native / hybrid app. 

Customers would have to scan-in using the QR code on the app while entering the supermarket. Customer's phone number, GPS co-ordinates etc would be captured into the DB at this time. Upon successful registration, the main gate or the door of the supermarket would open. To avoid waiting at checkout queues, customers can self-checkout using the app which allows them to scan the barcode on the product, and calculate the final checkout price. App should allow making payment using credit card or through internet banking. 

If a customer have not paid while exiting from the supermarket, an alarm would trigger on the customer's phone, and the customer helpdesk can be notified too by sending them an alert. Customers who do not want to use this app can always shop as usual by entering through the ordinary gates/doors.

This app can be expanded to serve more than one supermarket. App development together with APIs, GPS location, SQLite DB, payment gateways  are some of the areas to be explored for the project.
